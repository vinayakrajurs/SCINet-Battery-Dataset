# SCINet-Battery-Dataset

We use ............. to generate synthetic battery datasets. This procedure is very beneficial during data scarce scenarios wherein researchers have access to finite amount of data. The leading contributions of this
This work includes:

1.)

2.)

# Procedure to run this code- 

1. Click on code and download zip
2. Upload the file on your google drive
3. Open the file with zip extractor in the drive
4. Then click open SCINet_Main.ipynb file and follow the code each step
5. You can click open the file in colab and run the file only after the file is mounted in your drive
6. All changes to the Prediction Length, epochs, dataset, etc. can be made in the 'run_main_SCINet.py' file 
7. Insertion of a new dataset must be done in the datasets folder as well as adding this data in the data parser in the 'run_main_SCINet.py' file and custom data in data_loader.py Line 192
8. You may make changes in the data set used and target to be run
