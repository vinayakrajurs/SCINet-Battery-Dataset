# SCINet-Battery-Dataset

In this work we try to provide feasible solutions to solve limited data situations using an Sample Convolution and Interactive Learning based approach. This work provides the following contributions:

1.) Creation of high-quality diverse synthetic battery param-
eter datasets

2.) This produced synthetic data should ensure adequate
heterogeneity

3.) For the first time, a Sample Convolution and Interactive
Learning based approach is introduced to achieve accurate battery parameter approximation.

# Procedure to run this code- 

1. Click on code and download zip
2. Upload the file on your google drive
3. Open the file with zip extractor in the drive
4. Then click open SCINet.ipynb file and follow the code each step
5. You can click open the file in colab and run the file only after the file is mounted in your drive
6. All changes to the Prediction Length, epochs, dataset, etc. can be made in the 'run_main_SCINet.py' file 
7. Insertion of a new dataset must be done in the datasets folder as well as adding this data in the data parser in the 'run_main_SCINet.py' file.
8. You may make changes in the data set used and target to be run
